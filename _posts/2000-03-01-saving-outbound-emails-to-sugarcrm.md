Compose the email you’d like to add to SugarCRM and add a recipient in the To field of the email. You can use search, {{ "magnifying-glass" | svg_icon }}, to bring up contacts from SugarCRM for recipient email address.

Check the Yathit toolbar to see if information about your recipient is being displayed. If so, then a Lead or Contact record already exists in SugarCRM and you’ll be able to save your email to their existing record. If necessary, click the Details button to modify related records.
