## How to track an email

To send a tracked email, just click email Tracking checkbox on an outbound email. This will let you know who opens your emails and links, when and where they do it. The person you send the email to won’t know that the email is being tracked--it’s different than a read receipt:

For more detail see [How email tracking works](how-email-tracking-work.html). 

## Get notified

When a recipient open a *recently* tracked email or link, you will be immediately notified from Chrome browser.

## Easy to view tracking

You can see the status of tracking of a message beside Gmail message thread.
