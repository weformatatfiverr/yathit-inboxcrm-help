[Sugarâ€™s Contacts module](http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/04_Sugar_Professional/Sugar_Professional_7.2/Application_Guide/11_Contacts/)  consists of individual people with whom your organization has a relationship. Contact records are typically related to an account record, and multiple contacts may be associated to a single account. There are various ways you can create contacts in Sugar such as via the Contacts module, importing contacts, converting leads to contacts, etc. Once the contact record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the contact via the Contacts record view. Each contact record may then relate to other Sugar records such as meetings, cases, opportunities, and many others, making the contact record a hub for viewing and continuing your interaction with the individual. This documentation will cover how to use the Contacts module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module..
